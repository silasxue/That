# That
A small Android project based on the Camera2Basic sample with Clarifai

Camera2Basic can be found here: https://github.com/googlesamples/android-Camera2Basic

To use this app, you must first get your own Clarifai client id and client secret over at https://developer.clarifai.com/

When you get those, add them to the strings.xml file as 

  \<string name="CLIENT_ID">YOUR_ID_HERE\</string>
  
  \<string name="CLIENT_SECRET">YOUR_SECRET_HERE\</string>
  
and you should be good to go.
